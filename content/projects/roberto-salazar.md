Identity in its entirety would be the centre of the self, the first and most defining state of mind which translates our world view into something tangible; a visual, phonetic and physical language. The current climate has made of our identity a silenced voice within a world underlying too much stress and chaos. We’re registered, categorised, our lives get more and more individual, biased and polarised. We lack a sense of belonging and togetherness. Instead we develop online and learn about ourselves with the help of AI. Essentially we’re living in parallel worlds while being static and without possibilities of change. 

Blurring the boundaries between performance and reality, *Created Identities: Blind Admiration Gets Us Nowhere* is a multimedia exhibition and an ongoing research project on hybrid identity, synergy, the extremes and the in-betweens. A call for the new generation of pro-actives emphasising the undoing of binary systems, deconstructing and working through codes of expression.

The goal is to raise awareness, evoke empathy, engage the concept of abundance and influence a collective feeling that makes you ask yourself:\
What about my identity? What about my essence?\
What could be new ways of learning or rather un*learning?\
How do I act upon a greater good and less on individuality?\
How can we all win?
